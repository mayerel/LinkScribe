                    Welcome to LinkScribe. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website,

                    LinkScribe is a tool that allows users to generate professional social media posts from public 
                    article URLs. The content generated is intended for informational and editorial purposes and should be 
                    reviewed before publication.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>
                    You must be at least 18 years old to use LinkScribe. By using the Service, you confirm that you meet 
                    this requirement and have the authority to agree to these Terms.
                </p>

                <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree not to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
                    <li>Upload or link to content that infringes on intellectual property rights.</li>

                <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>
                    LinkScribe and its components (branding, UI, algorithms, design) are owned by or licensed to us and 
                    protected under intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable 
                    license to use the Service as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You retain ownership of the LinkedIn post content generated, but LinkScribe reserves the right to 
                    store, improve upon, or use anonymized versions of user-generated content to improve the platform.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Content</h2>
                <p>
                    The Service relies on user-submitted URLs to publicly available articles. LinkScribe does not claim 
                    ownership over, or take responsibility for, the original content contained in those URLs. Users are 
                    responsible for ensuring they have the right to share and summarize such content.
                </p>

                <h2>6. No Guarantee of Accuracy</h2>
                <p>
                    While we strive to provide useful, high-quality output, all content generated by LinkScribe should 
                    be reviewed and edited by the user before posting publicly. We make no guarantees about the factual 
                    accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of the content.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, LinkScribe and its team will not be liable for any indirect, 
                    incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of (or inability to use) the Service.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Modifications to the Service</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update or discontinue parts of the Service at any time, with or without notice. We are not 
                    liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time and for any 
                    reason, including breach of these Terms.
                </p>
